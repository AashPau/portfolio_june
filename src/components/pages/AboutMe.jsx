            Driven by a strong ambition to fulfill my career goal as a Software
            Developer/Engineer. Dedicated to expanding my knowledge of
            technologies and their fundamentals, I graduated from University
            with a Bachelor of Information Technology in Software Development.
            This education provided me with a robust programming skill set.
            Through self-directed learning and hands-on project experience,
            including my most recent role as a Software Developer, I have
            further developed my professional expertise.
